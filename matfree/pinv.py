def pinv_tall(Av: Callable, vA: Callable, *, solve: Callable) -> Callable:
    r"""Construct the (Moore-Penrose) pseudo-inverse of a full-rank, ''tall'' matrix.

    Implemented as a left-inverse, $A^\dagger := A^* (A A^*)^{-1}$,
    which is applicable if $A$ has full **column**-rank.

    Parameters
    ----------
    Av:
        Matrix-vector product function.
    vA:
        Vector-matrix product function.
    solve:
        Solution of a linear system. Maps a matrix-vector production function and a
        right-hand-side vector to the solution of the linear system.

    Returns
    -------
    Callable
        Matrix-vector product function that implements
        the pseudo-inverse of the matrix-vector product function `Av`.
